# ns3

## This repository contains ns3 scripts for the following problems-

1) Create a topology of two nodes (Node1, Node2) separated by a point-to-point link specifying bandwidth & delay, deploy UDP Echo application for transferring 5 packets at an interval of 1 sec.

2) Create a scenario of P2P(2 node) and CSMA channel(4 nodes) specifying bandwidth 5Mbps and 100Mbps respectively. Study IP addresses assignment mechanism and pcap file generation.

3) Create a topology to show UDP Transfer by Setting up UdpClient and a UdpServer on Nodes.

4) Introduction and implementation of wifi channel in a network using NS3 simulations.

5) Write NS3 simulation program to show the use of topology helpers for creating a network.

6) Write NS3 simulation program to implement Adhoc Network
